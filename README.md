# **MusicMix â€“ Offline android app**

This was a school (SKP - skolepraktik) project.

This is an offline mobile application that finds all songs on the user's device and displays them. The user can listen to songs and save songs in playlists which the user can also create and delete. Playlists are stored locally on the mobile phone.
I have a "Home" screen which is also used to display all songs, a screen to search for songs and one to create or delete playlists

_Here is a home screen screenshot:_
